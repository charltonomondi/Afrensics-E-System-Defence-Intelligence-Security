					Over 1.1 million business records compromised at Kenyan registry of companies
				</div>
				<section className="mb-8">
					<h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Incident Overview</h2>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Kenya’s Business Registration Service (B.R.S) experienced a significant cyber attack on the night of 31 January 2025, resulting in a data breach that exposed sensitive information. According to B.R.S statistics, the compromised data includes details about company ownership, directorship, and beneficial ownership of over 1,111,450 companies both private and public registered since 2015. Analysis by key Kenyan media reports following the attack indicates that the state confirmed breach of the sole custodian of the country’s company registry, raises concerns about the security of sensitive individual and business information, highlighting weaknesses in the protection of critical personal and corporate data.
					</p>
					<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						Weak protection of critical personal and corporate data can lead to serious consequences for victims.
					</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section className="mb-8">
					<h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Cybersecurity weaknesses?</h2>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Kenya’s Business Daily has said a little-known Moldovan business intelligence firm allegedly exploited a weakness in Kenya's government-owned Business Registration Service (BRS) to gain access to sensitive data of major shareholders in registered firms. The report, refuted by B2bHint, says the firm accessed and subsequently offered for sale a substantial amount of sensitive data from over two million Kenyan companies. This data included personal details such as residential addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of significant shareholders. The firm reportedly sold this information for as much as Sh. 24 million for a comprehensive package, with individual phone numbers priced as low as $0.015.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						According to the same Business Daily report, B2b Hint denied hacking the BRS system, attributing its access to a perceived weakness in the BRS's cybersecurity standards. B2bHint refuted the claim that they hacked into the BRS system, saying the data was accessed through public URLs that were not adequately protected, rather than through a direct breach or hacking. B2bhint representatives clarified that their access to the data was based on the public availability of information and not as a result of malicious hacking. The Moldovan firm the data was exposed due to the BRS's cybersecurity weaknesses, rather than any illegal breach on their part.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section className="mb-8">
					<h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Response from Kenyan authorities</h2>
					<p className="mb-4">
						BRS Director General Kenneth Gathuma confirmed the breach, emphasizing that the organization was strengthening its cybersecurity measures in response and that investigations were ongoing to understand the scope and prevent further incidents. The Ministry of Information, Communications, and the Digital Economy insisted that the data breach had been addressed.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section className="mb-8">
					<h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What is at stake?</h2>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Whether it was through hacking or cybersecurity weaknesses, the BRS breach on 31 January 2025 is notable for its scale. With sensitive data now exposed to the public domain raises concerns about its potential misuse. This could negatively impact investor confidence and erode trust in Kenya's regulatory systems. Restoring trust will require clear and transparent communication about the breach, its consequences, and the steps taken to address it.
					</p>
					<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						The prospect of critical personal and corporate data on sale in the dark web is unsettling.
					</blockquote>
					<p className="mb-4">
						While some analysts have suggested the possibility dark web sale of the hacked personal data, the exposure of the data-rich BRS, could lead to identity theft, fraud, or targeted social engineering attacks, particularly as it contains information about both companies and beneficial owners of the companies.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						The ongoing investigation into the origins of the BRS attack is crucial. Authorities are examining the breach for signs of advanced persistent threats (APTs), as well as identifying whether the attack is linked to broader geopolitical concerns. In previous incidents, such as the Stuxnet attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities in 2010, investigators traced the attack to a nation-state-backed effort using highly sophisticated malware.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						In other breaches in the past, there was disruption of operations and compromised customer data. This is the case in South Africa, where a 2019 ransomware attack on City Power Johannesburg disrupted operations and compromised customer data. The breach demonstrated the significant impact such attacks can have on both public trust and the operational capacity of vital services. Following this incident, South African companies were advised to invest in cybersecurity awareness training.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Following a 2019 Nigerian National Information Technology Development Agency, where personal data belonging to millions of citizens was exposed, Nigerian authorities called for stronger data protection regulations, which were echoed by international data protection standards such as GDPR. This incident highlights the importance of regulatory compliance in cybersecurity and data management.

					<p className="mb-4">
						WhatsApp group users in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, have reported incidents where an attacker gains control of a victim member’s phone number, they can take over the WhatsApp account and access all messages, media, contacts, and group information associated with that account. Many are familiar with messages that seek to get members to click on a link and those who fall prey to this have their personal information stolen.

					</blockquote>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Recent incidents in these countries show that WhatsApp is a prime target for SIM swapping because it uses phone numbers as unique identifiers for accounts. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous for WhatsApp because it relies on phone numbers for authentication.

				<section className="mb-8">
					<h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What is SIM Swapping?</h2>
					<p className="mb-4">
						SIM swapping (or SIM card swapping) is a type of identity theft in which an attacker tricks a mobile carrier into switching a phone number from its legitimate owner’s SIM card to one under the attacker’s control. Once the hacker has control of the victim’s phone number, they can gain access to various online services, especially those that use SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA).
					</p>
					<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
						<li>Social Engineering: The attacker typically starts by gathering personal information about the victim.</li>
						<li>Contacting the Carrier: The attacker then contacts the victim’s mobile service provider, claiming to be the victim.</li>
						<li>SIM Card Activation: If the hacker successfully convinces the carrier, the victim's phone number is transferred to a new SIM card in the attacker’s possession.</li>
						<li>Hijacking Accounts: The attacker can use it to intercept SMS-based authentication codes and take over accounts.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section className="mb-8">
					<h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Why is SIM Swapping Dangerous?</h2>
					<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
						<li>Account Access: Hackers can reset passwords and access email, banking, social media, and WhatsApp.</li>
						<li>Financial Loss: Cybercriminals may exploit access to online banking, mobile money, or cryptocurrency accounts.</li>
						<li>Personal Data Exposure: Attackers can steal sensitive data, leading to identity theft or further scams.</li>

					<h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What to remember</h2>
					<p className="mb-4">
						WhatsApp’s business model involves data sharing with its parent company, Facebook (now Meta). This has raised concerns about user data privacy, especially in regions with weak data protection laws, including many African countries.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						WhatsApp Web, the platform's browser-based version, has its own set of vulnerabilities. When users link their phone to the web app, malicious actors can potentially gain control of a user’s account if the phone is compromised, or if the browser session is hijacked.
