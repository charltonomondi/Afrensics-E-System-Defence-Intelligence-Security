              We will retain your personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected (including to satisfy any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements). When it is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize it.

              We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
